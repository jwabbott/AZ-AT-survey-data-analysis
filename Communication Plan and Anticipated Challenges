Communication Plan:
We both understand and aim to uphold consideration for the complexities of personal life, work, and other commitments that we both are obligated to, and plan to communicate proactively, schedule regular Zoom meetings, and create equitable task management plans for the various elements of the final project. We both have been in several classes together in the past and are excited to have the opportunity to collaborate for this project.

Anticipated Challenges:
(Definitely Markkus, only speaking for self) Coding in Git/Bash is brand new to me, while I am confident that I can troubleshoot issues, I might not come to conclusions with the efficiency of an expert: I am very open to learning more efficient ways of writing code, but I anticipate that it won't come naturally, and I won't have an instinctive sense of what is wrong in a code.
Another challenge in the data is the number of variables, and the fact that they are in a number of different forms: some is continuous, some is categorical, and some is ordinal. If this will pose challenges to creating similarity scores, I don't know yet, but I am familiar with the data from having worked with it, so I can easily address formatting issues if they become challenging.
