—Overview—
-This GitHub Site hosts data from a survey, conducted of Arizona and Austrian citizens, shortly after the 2022 midterm cycles of the national elections. The survey gathered socio-economic, behavioral and insights about respondents, as well as data from more complex composite scales. 

—Features—
-There are a number of Jupyter Notebooks that can be used to demonstrate various steps in the data cleaning and preparation process, including one that re-scales a number of the composite scores, which were on various scales: 3-21, 0-5, etc. into a 0-1 score, with decimal points re-scaled to make these composite variables more comparable.

-Jupyter Notebook (mostly Markdown) exploring the survey questions, scales, and data format, some simple descriptive stats
-Original CSV file with data in the un-altered state (not all measures included as in original survey)

-Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the process of using MinMax to re-scale composite data points
-CSV with re-scaled data, and composite scores MinMaxed

-Jupyter Notebook demonstrating Testing of Data for row and column completeness, testing of MinMax re-scaling, etc.

-Jupyter Notebook allowing users to generate visualizations of networks based on:
	-Gender: Male, Female, Other
	-Election (2022): Voted Democrat, Voted Republican, Did not vote.
After users choose a starting variable, they can choose a “similarity threshold” which will reduce the edges of the network (above .8 is most effective). The Notebook also allows users to input a specific respondent’s ID number and generate a list of other nodes that have the highest “similarity score”, as calculated by a function in the notebook. Similarity scores are calculated based on the cosine similarity of two respondents, with vectors representing their results ranging from -1 to +1 (-1 indicating a low similarity, +1 indicating the highest similarity).
 ****NOTE**** This feature is not completely functional because it is currently calculating based on ALL of the composite scores, and ideally, a user could choose specific variables to compare, or exclude others.

-Jupyter Notebook with Analysis of Crisis Categories COMING SOON: This notebook will demonstrate a similar exploration as the above notebook, but looking specifically at the categorical crisis responses that individuals gave. The comparative variables might change here as well, instead of looking at Gender and Voting history as predictors, we might look at income or education levels.



—Installation—
	Prerequesites:
	-Python Version 3.7+
	-Install Packages: 
pip install pandas numpy networkx scikit-learn matplotlib plotly



—Usage—
After familiarizing yourself with the data and format of the CSV files, choose a Jupyter Notebook to explore:
-Explore the network visualizations based on Gender or Voting history, and change the threshold to see different network densities to emerge. Theis JN is designed to be interactive, based on the Plotly visualization features, and individual nodes can be examined and identified in relation to specific others in the network. ***NOTE*** This JN is still in development, there are features that are not yet perfectly implemented, including that the nodes are ID in the order they appear in the CSV rows, rather than the ID number that they were assigned for the survey. This should still be fixed before the final submission.
