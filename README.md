We are working on a data set gathered by a survey of Austria and Arizona-based respondents in the Summer of 2023. 
The survey included questions about demographic, political, social, and personality/daily living habits, 
as well as the perception of various crisis categories. 

We are interested in identifying clusters across various segments of respondents to better understand
why some people choose not to participate in the election process by voting.
