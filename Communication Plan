We both understand and aim to uphold consideration for the complexities of personal life, work, and other commitments that we both are obligated to, and plan to communicate proactively, schedule regular Zoom meetings, and create equitable task management plans for the various elements of the final project. We both have been in several classes together in the past and are excited to have the opportunity to collaborate for this project.
