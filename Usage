—Usage—
After familiarizing yourself with the data and format of the CSV files, choose a Jupyter Notebook to explore:
-Explore the network visualizations based on Gender or Voting history, and change the threshold to see different network densities to emerge. Theis JN is designed to be interactive, based on the Plotly visualization features, and individual nodes can be examined and identified in relation to specific others in the network. ***NOTE*** This JN is still in development, there are features that are not yet perfectly implemented, including that the nodes are ID in the order they appear in the CSV rows, rather than the ID number that they were assigned for the survey. This should still be fixed before the final submission.
